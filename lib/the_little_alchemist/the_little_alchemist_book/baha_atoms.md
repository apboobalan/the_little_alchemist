### Here comes the somewhat unique concept.

We want to name a concept and we want to use it at many places.  
We can say strings.  
But strings are commonly used to manipulate concepts, while atoms are used to name concepts.

name = "Alchemist"  
"Welcome #{name}!" will produce "Welcome Alchemist!"

_Yes we are interpolating strings. Inserting values into a string_  
`#{}` The expressions inside {} will be evaluated and converted to strings and then inserted into the containing string.
