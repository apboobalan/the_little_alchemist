### Here comes the `:atoms`

We prepend string values with : to make it an atom.  
If it's a single word we don't have to surround string with "".  
- :ok
- :error

If it contains space
- :"team alchemy"

But we can avoid these in our code and stay with single words or separate words with _ to improve readability.
- :team_alchemy
