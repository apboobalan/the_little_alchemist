### We would like to group a concept. How can we go about it.

We can group values which are limited in number by surrounding them by {} separated by commas.
- Represent a point `{1,2}`
- Represent coordinates of a place `{0,0}`
- Represent success message from a function call `{:ok, 5}`
- Represent error message from a function call `{:error, "Invalid argument passed."}`
