### Here comes the `:atoms`

We prepend string values with **:** to make it an atom.  
If it's a single word we don't have to surround string with **""**.  
 `:ok`  
 `:error`

To include space we have to surround them by **""** 
 `:"team alchemy"`

But we can avoid these in our code and stay with single word or separate words with _ (snake case) to improve readability.  
 `:team_alchemy`
