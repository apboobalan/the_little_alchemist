Till now we are using single value to represent a concept.
- How many users visited the page? `1000`.
- What's the temperature now? `24.3` celcius.
- What's the status of a call? `:ok`
- How am I writing this book? `"Typing words like this!"`

But there are instances where we want to represent concepts with more than one value.
- How would you represent a list of users who visited today.
- How would you represent specification of a car.
- How would you represent points in a 3d environment.

Next we will see how to mix and match the already seen data types, following some conventions, to represent complex concepts.
