### Did you get the hint? ;)
Yes we would like to represent list of users using **lists**.  
We can represent list by enclosing values by square bracket, separated by commas.
- List of users `["Alchemist 1", "Alchemist 2", "Alchemist 3"]`
- List of statuses on an order `[:cart, :preorder, :payment, :dispatch, :delivery, :finished, :refund]`
