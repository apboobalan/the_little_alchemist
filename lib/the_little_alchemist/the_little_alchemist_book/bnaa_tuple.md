### We would like to group a concept. How can we go about it.

We can group values which are limited in number by surrounding them by {} separated by commas.
- Represent a point `{1,2}` {x, y}
- Represent coordinates of a place `{0,0}` {latitude, longitude}
- Successfully read temperature from a service `{:ok, 5}` {status, temperature}
- Represent error message from a function call `{:error, "Invalid argument passed."}` {status, reason}
