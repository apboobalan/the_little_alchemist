### Another convenient data type frequently used in Elixir.
**keyword list**.  
- It's a list of 2 element tuples with the first element of tuple being an atom.
- `[{:valid, true}, {:points, 5}]`
- We use this frequently in Elixir so we have an alternate easy form of `[valid: true, points: 5]`
- Just remember this and We would discuss its usage later.
