I am hearing "Where is the code?".Here it is.   
- To run the codes we discussed earlier, install elixir using homebrew or linuxbrew.
- Go to any terminal and type `iex`. You will be presented with an iex environment where we can play with the values.
Don't get angry. Typing those values would just print back the values.  
To really play with it we need variables, operators and functions.

### variables
- `a = 1`
- `age = 30`
- `name = "Alchemist"`
- `max_distance = 50`
>Note that variables are sequence of alphabets which are not surrounded by double quotes and starts with a lower case letter.  
It's convention to use snake case.
