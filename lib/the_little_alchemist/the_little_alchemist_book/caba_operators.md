What are operators? You guessed it right.
=, +, -, *, /, ==, <, >, <=, >=, &&, ||, and, or, not, |>(which we will see later)
- `=` we already used this to assign value to a variable. name = "alchemist". name will carry the value of alchemist.
- `+, -, *, /` used to manipulate numerical values. 1 + 2 -> 3, 2 * 2 -> 4 etc.
- `==, <, >, <=, >=` used to compare two values. 1 == 1 -> true, 1 < 2 -> true, 1>2 -> false etc.
- `&&, ||, and, or, not` used to manipulate two boolean values. true && true -> true, false or true -> true, not true -> false etc

These are basic, common operations, hence we borrow these from mathematics to manipulate values.
