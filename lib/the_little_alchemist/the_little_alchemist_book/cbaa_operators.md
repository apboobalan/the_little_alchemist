What are operators? You guessed it right.
`=, +, -, *, /, ==, <, >, <=, >=, &&, ||, and, or, not, |>`(which we will see later)
- `=` we already used this to assign value to a variable. `name = "alchemist"`. name will carry the value of string "alchemist".
- `+, -, *, /` used to manipulate numerical values. `1 + 2` is 3, `2 * 2` is 4 etc.
- `==, <, >, <=, >=` used to compare two values. `1 == 1` is true, `1 < 2` is true, `1>2` is false etc.
- `&&, ||, and, or, not` used to manipulate two boolean values. `true && true` is true, `false or true` is true, `not true` is false etc

These are basic common operations, hence we borrow these from mathematics to manipulate values.
