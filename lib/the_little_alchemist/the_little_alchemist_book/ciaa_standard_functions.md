 Now we know how to define Modules and functions. We see some of the standard ones that come with Elixir.  
 `String.downcase("WoRlD")` will give "world".   
 we are executing `downcase` function from `String` module.   
 `List.first([1, 2])` will give 1.  
 we are executing `first` function from `List` module.
